Node.js architecture centers around its event loop, which manages asynchronous tasks such as file system operations, network requests, and database queries. This event-driven model allows Node.js to handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently. Additionally, Node.js utilizes the libuv library to abstract non-blocking I/O operations across different platforms, ensuring consistent behavior. Its module system enables modular development, facilitating code organization and reuse. Node.js also provides a rich ecosystem of npm packages, offering a vast array of libraries and tools to extend its functionality. Furthermore, Node.js can be deployed in various environments, including servers, desktop applications, and IoT devices, making it versatile and adaptable to different use cases.
